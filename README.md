# Prusa i3 mk3 led lights
A 3D printable set of mounts to add lights to your i3 mk3 (probably works on mk2 also but I don't have one to test).
The mounts clip on to the existing frame and require no modification.
It is modeled in Solidworks 2017 with both the Solidworks files and STLs ready for printing included.

I printed all of the parts using Prusa orange PETG at 0.15 mm layer heights and they printed without issue.
The files here contain some slight adjustments from the parts that I printed that should make them easier to assemble.
You will need to mirror the top bracket and bottom panel to suit left and right sides (I did this in my slicer).

I have wired up mine so that the light are on seperate switches. 
A switch on the top controls both of the top two lights. 
A switch on the bottom allows either of the two bottom lights to be turned on indivdually. 
I find this a good arranglement as when you have both of the bottom lights on, one of them is shining in your eyes and is annoying.
I used adhesive backed 24 V LED strips that are 4 LEDs wide and super bright(38.4 W/m).
The top two lights use a 50 mm strip each and the bottom two use a 100 mm strip.
This provides more than enough light to see how your print is going.
